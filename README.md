# Project-Austin-House-Price-Prediction
This project involves predicting house prices in Austin, Texas, using machine learning algorithms. The dataset includes housing characteristics, from structural details to amenities. 
Key steps include:
•	Feature Engineering: Added custom features like house age, total features, and combined bedroom-bathroom count to enrich the dataset.
•	Data Splitting & Cross-Validation: Used an 80/20 split for training and testing, applying k-fold cross-validation (k=10).
•	Modeling: Built multiple predictive models—Linear Regression, Regression Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting—to identify the best-performing algorithm.
•	Evaluation: Compared models based on Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), visualizing results to assess accuracy.
